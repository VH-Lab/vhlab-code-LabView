# vhlab_LabViewCode
LabView code used and written by the VH Lab

We still haven't figured out how to hand around LabView code.  For example, VHLVDaq will complain that it can't find certain .vi files that are actually included in your LabView distribution.  Please bear with us as we try to figure this out.  Thanks
Steve
